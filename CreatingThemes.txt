Introduction

Creating your own theme for SnailUI is not very complicated at all once you learn how to do it.
Today I am going to walk you through the steps of creating your own theme and the different ways of doing it. I recommend at having at least a basic understanding of how programming and Lua works before continuing but it's not 100% necessary.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

File structure

Before we do anything, you will need to create and edit a few basic files to get started. You will need to do this for every theme/file you create.
Don't worry though, it doesn't take very long. :P

First, you are going to want to create your theme file.
	1. Navigate to SnailUI / Themes
	2. Create a folder and name it what you want your theme to be called (I am naming mine MyTheme for this tutorial)

	-- Replace MyTheme with your theme name for the rest of this tutorial --

	3. Open the new folder and create a blank file (Right click -> New -> Text Document)
	4. Name it MyTheme.lua

Now that we have the basic file structure done, we need to add the file to SnailUI's "file cache" so to speak, so that the addon will load your files.
	1. Navigate to the base SnailUI folder
	2. Open SnailUI.toc in Notepad or any other text editor
	3. Find the section with the theme files (Will look like Themes\Blah\Blah)
	4. Add the following text under the last theme related line:

	Themes\MyTheme\MyTheme.lua

	5. Save and exit Notepad

Keep in mind that every time you edit a .toc file, you need to restart your game for it to take effect. Now that we have that out of the way, we can begin to edit our new theme.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Method 1: From scratch

Using this method, you will be creating your theme from scratch. This means that you will have to manually position various elements as well as design everything yourself.
Generally, this is what you will want to be doing when you want to create a new theme as it allows greater freedom.

So now we will begin.
	1. Navigate to SnailUI / Themes / MyTheme
	2. Open MyTheme.lua in Notepad or any other text editor
	3. Copy the following code into the blank file:

	Configuration.Themes.MyTheme = 
	{
	}

	4. Save and exit Notepad

We now have the framework for our theme, you can change themes by using the in-game options. (/SUI or /SnailUI -> General -> Theme)
Now we can start to create the various elements of our theme. For right now, all we will do is create a basic player frame.

To do this, all you will need to do is:
	1. Navigate to SnailUI / Themes / MyTheme
	2. Open MyTheme.lua in Notepad or any other text editor
	3. Copy the following code in-between the brackets: (In-between the { and })

	Player =
	{
		Anchor = "CENTER",
		Height = 24,
		Width = 256,
		X = 0,
		Y = 0,

		HealthBar =
		{
			Anchor = "TOP",
			Height = 15,
			Orientation = "HORIZONTAL",
			Width = 252,
			X = 0,
			Y = -3,

			Health =
			{
				Anchor ="CENTER",
				X = 1,
				Y = 0
			}
		},

		PowerBar =
		{
			Anchor = "BOTTOM",
			Height = 4,
			Orientation = "HORIZONTAL",
			Width = 252,
			X = 0,
			Y = 3
		}
	}

	4. Save and exit Notepad

I'm not going to go over every variable because they are pretty self-explanatory. Congratulations, you have just created your first theme!
Though basic, it is a great accomplishment and you should be proud. :D

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Method 2: Extending a theme

Using this method, you will be extending an existing theme. This means that you will already have all of the elements of the theme you are extending + any that you might want to add or remove. You can also change positions, sizes, etc.
Generally, you won't be doing this unless you only want to make very minor changes to an existing theme.

Let's begin, shall we?
	1. Navigate to SnailUI / Themes / MyTheme
	2. Open MyTheme.lua in Notepad or any other text editor
	3. Copy the following code into the blank file:

	Configuration.Themes.MyTheme = DeepCopy(Configuration.Themes.Default)

	4. Save and exit Notepad

All this is doing is copying an existing theme (in this case, the default theme) into your theme. You can change themes by using the in-game options. (/SUI or /SnailUI -> General -> Theme)
Now let's say for example, we wanted to center the player frame for some reason. We could do this by modifying a few lines of code that already exist within the theme.
	1. Navigate to SnailUI / Themes / MyTheme
	2. Open MyTheme.lua in Notepad or any other text editor
	3. Copy the following code under the first line:

	Configuration.Themes.MyTheme.Player.Anchor = "CENTER"
	Configuration.Themes.MyTheme.Player.X = 0
	Configuration.Themes.MyTheme.Player.Y = 0

	4. Save and exit Notepad

Pretty cool right? You can add your own variables, change values, or remove settings by setting them to nil this way. It's all up to you and your imagination. :)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion

This was not a very in-depth guide but it was never really meant to be. If you want to know more about the various theme elements, I would recommend looking at the default theme files in SnailUI / Themes / Default.

Anyway, that's it for this guide. Hope you enjoyed it!
