SnailUI
Written by Snail

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SnailUI is a pixel perfect UI, meaning everything is aligned perfectly. SnailUI skins almost everything, including the minimap, action bar, casting bars, etc. SnailUI is currently in a beta state, so there are probably plenty of bugs to be found. I would appreciate it if you reported them in the comments or through Twitter. :)

A lot of aspects of SnailUI can be changed via the in game interface options (or by typing /SUI or /SnailUI) or via the lua files themselves. This UI is also using !NoTaint to fix talent related bugs and Tuk's warlock bars addon as a temporary fix until oUF is updated. Should you need to contact me, I can be found via Twitter. (@1Snail)

Features
- Fully supports any resolution (less than 1024x768 can look strange) and any multisample level
- Theme based UI
- Supports all classes and specs, changing based on what your current spec is
- Some specific talents are supported (Such as removing pet bars if you have Grimoire of Sacrifice for Warlocks)
- A lot of Healbot-esque features are supported such as health prediction
- Very small and very fast
- Hides a lot of frames that you do not need to see in combat to reduce clutter (Can be shown by clicking the 'Show Misc Frames' button at the top [requires you to hover over it first])
- Widescreen action buttons (First time I have ever seen someone do this)
- Easy central focused class bars to help you watch your character more easily (Get out of that fire!)
- Easy to extend or create your own themes
- All class bars are supported (Combo point bar, rune bar, etc.)
- Automatically repairs your items when visiting a vendor
- Automatically sells all gray items when visiting a vendor
- Automatically releases when you die in a battleground
- Action/item button cooldown text that is similar to OmniCC
- Extremely lightweight dps/healing meter that also shows players of the the opposite faction and players outside of your group (Most pets can't be merged if the players are not in your group)
- A lot of Blizzard frames are skinned (Bag, action bars, minimap, etc.)
- Buff/debuff/cooldown timers for each class/spec
- Dispellable debuff indicators for raid frames
- Healing indicators for raid frames
- Automatically rolls greed on green items
- Automated garbage collector that periodically frees up memory
- Chat filters to reduce spam

You can also stay up to date with the cutting edge versions of SnailUI by visiting its GitHub repository here: https://github.com/SnailXI/SnailUI (The files here can change many times a day so it's not recommended to use this version of SnailUI unless you know what you are doing)

Installation

Read: SnailUI relies on both oUF and oUF_SpellRange, so make sure that these 2 addons are installed before continuing. To install SnailUI, just unzip the SnailUI folder into your World of Warcraft / Interface / Addons folder and you are good to go.
