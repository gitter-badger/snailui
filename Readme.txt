SnailUI

SnailUI is a pixel perfect UI, meaning everything is aligned perfectly. SnailUI skins almost everything, including the minimap, action bar, casting bars, etc. SnailUI is currently in a beta state, so there are probably plenty of bugs to be found. I would appreciate it if you reported them on the comments page for this addon. 

This UI is also using Tuk's warlock bars addon as a temporary fix until oUF is updated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

Features
- Supports all classes and specs, changing based on what your current spec is (Requires a /reload to take effect)
- Some specific talents are supported (Such as removing pet bars if you have Grimoire of Sacrifice for Warlocks)
- A lot of Healbot-esque features are supported such as health prediction
- Very small and very fast
- Hides a lot of frames that you do not need to see in combat to reduce clutter (Can be shown by clicking the 'Show Misc Frames' button at the top [requires you to hover over it first])
- Widescreen action buttons (First time I have ever seen someone do this)
- Easy central focused class bars to help you watch your character more easily (Get out of that fire!)
- Easy to extend or create your own themes

Download

You can download this release here: http://www.wowinterface.com/download...d20900-SnailUI

Mirrors of all of the SnailUI releases can be found here: https://github.com/1Snail/SnailUI/downloads

You can also stay up to date with the cutting edge versions of SnailUI by visiting its GitHub repository here: https://github.com/downloads/1Snail/SnailUI (The files here can change many times a day so it's not recommended to use this version of SnailUI unless you know what you are doing)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

Installation

Read: SnailUI relies on both oUF (the latest version from Haste's GitHub page here: https://github.com/haste/oUF/zipball/master) and oUF_SpellRange so make sure that these 2 addons are installed before continuing. To install SnailUI, just unzip the SnailUI folder into your World of Warcraft / Interface / Addons folder and you are good to go.
